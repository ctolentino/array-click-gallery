		<p id = "p1">Artist Tom Whalen’s been making posters and prints for well over a decade, and his inimitable style has caught the attention of Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Microsoft and more. Whalen’s a key figure in the modern poster scene, and is featured as an interviewee in 24x36: A Movie About Movie Posters (now streaming exclusively on Tribeca Shortlist). We spoke with Tom about his work, his inspiration, how he first got into the biz.</p>
